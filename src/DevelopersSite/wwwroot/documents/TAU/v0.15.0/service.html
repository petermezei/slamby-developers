<h2 id="services">Services</h2>
<p>Using Slamby you can freely create data processing services. Each service has a dedicated API endpoint that you can use for data processing.
Each service has custom settings availability to create a customized processor.</p>
<p>Service creation steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create Empty Service,</li>
<li>Provide custom setting and start training/preparation,</li>
<li>Provide custom activation settings,</li>
<li>Activate service.</li>

<td>1.</td>
<td>Create Empty Service</td>
<td>To create a service, first step is to create an empty one. During this process you can select the type of the service, provide the name and description of it. When the service is ready, the service unique ID already exists. After creation process is done the service status is <code>New</code></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Preparation</td>
<td>Next step is to prepare the service. During this process you can set your custom settings about the training process. When preparation starts, service status will be changed to <code>Busy</code>. When the preparation finishes, the status will be changed to <code>Prepared</code>.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Activation</td>
<td>Prepared services can be activated. When a service is prepared it means the training and setting process is ready, the service is ready to use, all the required files are ready to use. Without activation you cannot use the service. Before activation you can set your custom settings about the API endpoint to customize your data processing. During activation Slamby server reads the service and related files, opening an available API endpoint, loading the service into memory and become ready to serve your requests. When the service is activated, the status will be changed to <code>Activated</code>. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Test a Service</td>
<td>You can test your activated service by clicking on the recommend button. A test window pops-up with the available service details as a JSON document. You can fill it out and send your request to the service API endpoint. After sending your request you can see the response.</td>
